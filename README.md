Heart Disease UCI Dataset Analysis
This project involves an in-depth analysis of the Heart Disease UCI dataset, a widely-used benchmark dataset for predicting heart disease. The analysis includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of key trends and relationships in the dataset, such as correlations between attributes and their impact on heart disease diagnosis.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables for compatibility with machine learning models.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and engineering features to improve model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Building, training, and evaluating predictive models using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
Model Evaluation: Comparing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Insights and Recommendations: Identifying the most significant risk factors for heart disease and deriving actionable insights.
This project showcases data science skills, including data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Feel free to explore the code and results, and reach out with any feedback or collaboration ideas!
